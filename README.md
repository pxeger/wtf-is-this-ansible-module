# WTF is this Ansible Module?

With the move to collections in Ansible 2.10, development of the most common modules included by default with older
versions has moved to separate GitHub repositories (mostly under the `ansible-collections` organisation) because they
are part of separate collections now. Many have moved to `community.general`, but there are some in `ansible.posix` or
any number of other repositories. This is a tool to help you work out the "FQCN" of a module, or so that you know where
to file issues with a module.
